# Introduction

This is a python project dedicated to understanding Lefschetz fibrations, particularly through their monodromy representations. In particular the project is dedicated to exploring how the automorphism group of the (smooth) Lefschetz fibration maps to the smooth mapping class group of the base surface. At the moment it does not contain many features, but the author hopes to build upon these as they become relevant to her research. Any suggestions are welcome :)

Currently the file [LefschetzDisk.ipynb](LefschetzDisk.ipynb) handles all of the calculations for genus 1 Lefschetz fibrations. It includes the ability to generate orbit graphs, compute generating sets, and more. These are generally included in the Setup Cells. The remainder of the sections are scratchpads which I use for my personal research, and contain no guarantee of being maintained.

An auxiliary program contained in [elliptic-subgroups.gap](elliptic-subgroups.gap) takes care of determining the presentations of certain finite index subgroups of interest.

These two files are not very well-documented/structured for general purpose use. I am currently trying to remove the dependencies on Sage--which is incompatible with the curver library--in order to create a package which works in higher genus. In the process I hope to document the code more thoroughly, and make it easier to use in general.

# Installation

TODO

# Dependencies

This package depends on
- curver
- flipper
- networkx
- distribute
- cysignals
- setuptools
We are particularly grateful to Mark Bell, the creator of curver/flipper, for his effort in creating computational tools for mapping class groups.
